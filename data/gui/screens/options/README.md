# Options Screens

*Last Updated: 2025-12-30*

Settings and configuration screen layouts organized by category.

## Purpose

This directory contains .stkgui XML files that define the options/settings menu screens. Each screen uses a consistent vertical-tabs navigation pattern on the left side, allowing users to switch between General, Display, Graphics, Audio, Interface, Players, Controls, and Language settings. These screens provide access to all configurable game options.
