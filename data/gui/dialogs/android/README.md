Android-specific dialog layouts for touch device initialization and settings.

## Purpose

This directory contains .stkgui XML files that define dialog layouts specific to Android and other touch-enabled devices. These dialogs handle initial control type selection when launching on mobile platforms and provide access to advanced touch input configuration settings.

## Contents

| `init_android.stkgui` | First-run dialog for selecting control type (accelerometer, gyroscope, or steering wheel) with auto-acceleration toggle |
| `multitouch_settings.stkgui` | Touch device settings dialog with options for button scale, sensitivity, deadzone, accelerometer/gyroscope toggles, and inverted controls |
